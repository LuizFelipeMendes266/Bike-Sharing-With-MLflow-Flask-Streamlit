# Bike Sharing Demand with Mlflow, Flask and Streamlit

In this project, our goal is to perform an analysis on the Bike Sharing Demand dataset, seeking to explore different ways of consuming a generated model. In this case, I used Mlflow to register the model and Flask and Streamlit applications to serve the model. A brief exploratory analysis was done, which can be consulted in the notebook.
